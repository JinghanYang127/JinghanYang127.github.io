I am a five-year  undergraduate student in Basic Medical Science at the [Institute of Cardiovascular Science](https://xxgs.bjmu.edu.cn/), [Peking University Health Science Center](https://www.bjmu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liheng Wang](https://xxgs.bjmu.edu.cn/szll/PI/396a052a7ceb456f9b12d37a9dc731ab.htm). My research interests include stem cell differentiation, aging, and glucose and lipid metabolism.
